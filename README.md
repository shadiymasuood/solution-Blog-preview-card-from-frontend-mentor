# Blog Preview Card

This is my solution to the **Blog Preview Card** challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io).  
It helped me practice layout basics, spacing, and typography using only **HTML and CSS**.

## What I learned

During this project, I learned:

- How to structure a clean and semantic HTML layout  
- How to style cards using CSS (borders, spacing, shadows, alignment)  
- How to manage colors using HSL  
- How to adjust font sizes smoothly using modern CSS  
- **Here I learned Git, GitHub, deployment, and hosting for the first time — which helped me organize and publish my work professionally**

## A helpful insight I discovered

The mobile design uses slightly smaller font sizes.  
I searched for a way to scale typography **without media queries**, and I learned that:

### ✅ You can use `clamp()` to create responsive font sizes  
Example:

```css
font-size: clamp(0.9rem, 2.5vw, 1rem);
```
### Future Improvements

Create a full fluid type scale using CSS variables for each step.

Improve accessibility (contrast, line-length) and test multiple screen sizes.

### Tools used
HTML
CSS
Git & GitHub (forFrontend)
